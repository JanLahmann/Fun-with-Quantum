    "# Hardy's Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardy's Paradox nicely illustrates the fundamental difference of Quantum Mechanics and classical physics. In particular, it can be used to discuss the claim made by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (\"EPR\") back in 1935. They objected to the uncertainty seen in quantum mechanics, and thought it meant that the theory was incomplete. They thought that a qubit should always know what output it would give for both kinds of measurement, and that it only seems random because some information is hidden from us. As Einstein said: God does not play dice with the universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea and part of the source code for this tutorial was published in a previous version of the [Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/), in the (now removed) chapter [The Unique Properties of Qubits](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-textbook/blob/master/content/ch-states/old-unique-properties-qubits.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This variant of Hardy's Paradox is a relatively simple example for an entangled qubit state that could not be reproduced by a few classical bits and a random number generator. It shows that quantum variables aren't just classical variables with some randomness bundled in.\n",

    "\n",
    "(But careful: The CNOT-Gate differs according to the chosen control qubit!)\n",

    "#### Step 3: Excluding the 00-state\n",
    "\n",
    "The first rule requires our quantum circuit to exclude the 00-state (aka RED/RED) or in other words: The probability of measuring 00 int the Z-axis has to be 0.\n",
    "For this we use two RY-Gates and one CNOT. To explain what happens, let us first have a look on the $\\theta$-Values of the RY-Gates:\n",

    "1. In approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the time, a measurement after step 2 would result in 00.\n",
    "In this case, <b>none</b> of the conditions of the CNOT-Gates (the ones from step 2 and step 3) are met and therefore no Operation on the $q_0$ Qubit is performed (except for the RY-Gates). So all step 3 does is transferring the $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability to 01.\n",
    "2. In approximately $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the time, a measurement after step 2 would result in 11.\n",
    "In this case, <b>both</b> of the condition of the CNOT-Gates are met and therefore both times the X-Gate is performed on the $q_0$ Qubit. The outcome of this will be visible after the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, I want to stress something here: It should be clear that the CNOT-Gate is not doing \"nothing\" when its condition isn't met. We are still looking at an entangled system and there is one 4×1-vector describing the system. There are no two different calculations for each case above. Its one vector and one calculation (as you will see below) and every vector entry describes the probability for one specific case. This is also sometimes referred to as the property of quantum states to have <b> multiple bit states encoded at once</b>.\n",
    "\n",

    "In their famous paper in 1935, EPR essentially claimed that qubits can indeed be described by some form of classical variable. They did not know how to do it, but they were sure it could be done. Then quantum mechanics could be replaced by a much nicer and more sensible theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "It took until 1964 to show that they were wrong. J. S. Bell proved that quantum variables behaved in a way that was fundamentally unique. Since then, many new ways have been found to prove this, and extensive experiments have been done to show that this is exactly the way the universe works. We'll now consider a simple demonstration, using a variant of Hardy’s paradox."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, Hardy's paradox described a thought experiment by Lucien Hardy in the area of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment focuses on a particle and its anti-particle which interact without annihilating each other. The particles interfere with each other by two interferometers which are arranged in a way so that the paths of both particles overlap. The output each particle takes is the object of measurement. Our equivalent to the two particles are the two cars.\n",
    "As in our example, there seems to be the property that if you measure the output of one particle the measurement of the second particle always results in the same specific result. Parallel to our #2 property, classical logic would imply that a special output case of both particles is impossible which indeed is possible as measurements on both at once show. (Reminder for comparison: We wrongfully concluded from the second property that both cars could not be diesel. The measurements proofed us wrong.)\n",
    "\n",

    "The idea that measuring something is a completely neutral action is a common misconception. You always have to keep in mind that in quantum physics the measurement changes the system.\n",

    "This is (part of) what makes quantum computers able to outperform classical computers. It leads to effects that allow programs made with quantum variables to solve problems in ways that those with normal variables cannot. But just because qubits don’t follow the same logic as normal computers, it does not mean they defy logic entirely. They obey the definite rules laid out by quantum mechanics."

It leads to effects that allow programs made with quantum variables to solve problems in ways that those with normal variables cannot. But just because qubits don’t follow the same logic as normal computers, it doesn’t mean they defy logic entirely. They obey the definite rules laid out by quantum mechanics."
