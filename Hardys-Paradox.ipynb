    "# Hardy's Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardy's Paradox nicely illustrates the fundamental difference of Quantum Mechanics and classical physics. In particular, it can be used to discuss the claim made by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (\"EPR\") back in 1935. They objected to the uncertainty seen in quantum mechanics, and thought it meant that the theory was incomplete. They thought that a qubit should always have a determined output (regardless of the measurement axis), and that it only seems random because some information is hidden from us. In this case, all axes are [complementary observables](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10701-019-00261-3). They describe a property of quantum mechanics where each observable can be observed on its own but when trying to measure multiple at once, uncertainties arise. This essentially dates back to Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n",
    "As Einstein did not believe this, he said: \"God does not play dice with the universe\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea and part of the source code for this tutorial was published in a previous version of the [Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/), in the (now removed) chapter [The Unique Properties of Qubits](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-textbook/blob/master/content/ch-states/old-unique-properties-qubits.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This variant of Hardy's Paradox is a relatively simple example for an entangled qubit state that could not be reproduced by a few classical bits and a random number generator. It shows that quantum variables aren't just classical variables with some randomness bundled in. There are no \"hidden, local variables\".\n",
    "Especially, this paradox shows that classical reasoning is not applicable in quantum systems or in D. Mermins words: \"What didn't happen, didn't happen\". Meaning: We cannot infer the previous state of qubits by looking at the non-deterministic results of measurements. This also means that we cannot conclude hypothetical circuits that _never happened_ from our measurement. _We cannot infer something that didn't happen from something that happened._\n",
    "\n",
    "See D. Mermins book [Quantum Computer Science: An Introduction](https://library.uoh.edu.iq/admin/ebooks/22831-quantum_computer_science.pdf) for more information.\n",

    "\n",
    "(But careful: The CNOT-Gates matrix representation differs according to the chosen control qubit!)\n",

    "#### Step 3: Excluding the \"00\"-state\n",
    "\n",
    "The first property requires our quantum circuit to exclude the 00-state (aka RED/RED) or in other words: The probability of measuring \"00\" in the Z-axis has to be 0.\n",
    "For this we use two RY-Gates and one CNOT. To explain what happens, let us first have a look on the $\\theta$-Values of the RY-Gates:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> $ RY_0\\left(\\theta_0\\right) = RY_0\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ </p>\n",

    "<p> $ \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\frac{3\\pi}{4} = \\pi$ </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that both rotations together are equivalent to a Y-Gate. So which role do the CNOT-Gates play?\n",
    "To understand the effect of this, let us make a case distinction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In approximately one third of the time, a measurement after step 1 would result in the second qubit $q_1$ being \"0\".\n",
    "In this case, <b>none</b> of the conditions of the CNOT-Gates (the ones from step 2 and step 3) are met and therefore no Operation on the $q_0$ Qubit is performed (except for the RY-Gates). So all step 3 does is transferring the $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability to the \"01\"-state.\n",
    "2. In approximately two thirds of the time, a measurement after step 1 would result in the second qubit $q_1$ being \"1\".\n",
    "In this case, <b>both</b> of the condition of the CNOT-Gates are met and therefore both times the X-Gate is performed on the $q_0$ Qubit. The outcome of this will be visible after the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, I want to stress something here: It should be clear that the CNOT-Gate is not doing \"nothing\" when its condition isn't met. We are still looking at an entangled system and there is one 4×1-vector describing the system. There are no two different calculations for each case above. Its one vector and one calculation (as you will see below) and every vector entry describes the probability for one specific case. This is also sometimes referred to as the property of quantum states to have <b>multiple bit states encoded at once</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously the dimensions of the RY-Gate do not match with our entangled system. There we have to expand it by tensor multiplication with the I-Gate (Identity Gate) which essentially causes that we only use the gate on one qubit. _Reminder: As per Definition the Parameter $\\theta$ of the RY-Gate is mulitplied by $\\frac{1}{2}$ (see step 1)._\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In their famous paper in 1935, EPR essentially claimed that qubits can indeed be described by some form of classical variable. They did not know how to do it, but they were sure it could be done. Then quantum mechanics could be replaced by a much nicer and more sensible theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "It took until 1964 to show that they were wrong. J. S. Bell proved that quantum variables behaved in a way that was fundamentally unique. Since then, many new ways have been found to prove this, and extensive experiments have been done to show that this is exactly the way the universe works. We'll now consider a simple demonstration, using a variant of Hardy’s paradox."

    "### A thought experiment in quantum mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, Hardy's paradox described a thought experiment by Lucien Hardy in the area of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment focuses on a particle and its anti-particle which interact without annihilating each other. The particles interfere with each other by two interferometers which are arranged in a way so that the paths of both particles overlap. The output each particle takes is the object of measurement. Our equivalent to the two particles are the two cars.\n",
    "As in our example, there is the property that if you measure the output of one particle the measurement of the second particle always results in the same specific result. Parallel to our #2 property, classical logic would imply that a special output case of both particles is impossible which indeed is possible as measurements show. (Reminder for comparison: We wrongfully concluded from the second property that both cars could not be diesel. The measurements proofed us wrong.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about Hardy's paradox in quantum mechanics have a look at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%27s_paradox\">Wikipedia: Hardy's Paradox</a>."

    "## What went wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our mistake when trying to apply classical logic to a quantum mechanical system was in the following piece of reasoning.\n",

    "* By applying property 2 we can deduce what the result will be if we had made z measurements instead.\n",

    "We used our knowledge of the x (color) outputs to work out what the z (engine type) outputs were. Once we’d done that, we assumed that we were certain about the value of both.\n",

    "Our logic would be completely valid if we were not reasoning about quantum objects.\n",
    "But as D.Mermin concludes at the end of his excellent book [Quantum Computer Science: An Introduction](https://library.uoh.edu.iq/admin/ebooks/22831-quantum_computer_science.pdf), for quantum objects you have to accept \"what didn't happen didn't happen\", i.e. we cannot make an assumptions about a measurement that wasn't done.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea that measuring something is a completely neutral action is a common misconception. You always have to keep in mind that in quantum physics the measurement changes the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is (part of) what makes quantum computers able to outperform classical computers. It leads to effects that allow programs made with quantum variables to solve problems in ways that those with normal variables cannot. But just because qubits don’t follow the same logic as normal computers, it does not mean they defy logic entirely. They obey the definite rules laid out by quantum mechanics."
