   ]
  },

    "Communication is bilateral. Without proper forms of communication many situations but also games cannot be resolved in the classical sense. TThe Mermin-Peres magic square game is an example of this. It was first proposed by Aravind in 2002, based on the work of Mermin, 1990 and Peres, 1990. It operates, as illustrated below, according to the following scheme: two players, Alice and Bob, play against a game master on a 3x3 grid. They not allowed to communicate. The game master chooses a row and assigns it to Bob and a column is assigned to Alice. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rules state that the number of tiles placed by Alice in the column must be either zero or two tiles and those placed by Bob in the row must be also either zero or two tiles. However, there must be unity with respect to the intersecting cell, between the row and the column and at least one tile of either player must be placed there. As we can see below, there are various cases when one of the two players places a tile incohrently (i.e. both play a tile in the intersecting cell) and the game is subsequeently lost, so there is no guarantee that the game can be won with a probability of 1. Formally, in a 3x3 grip there are 9 distinct cells, however as presented above the number of total tiles placed is even, as a result Alice and Bob can't agree on a non-overlapping strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as an equilibrium strategy Alice and Bob can construct a 3x3 table, containing static examples of moves that can be played by them so that both of them win. However, a conflict between the winning conditions of Alice and Bob is bound to emerge, such that $\\frac 8 {9}$ tiles can be placed without conflict. Consequently, the game has a winning probability of $\\frac 8 {9}$.\n"

    "However, we can describe the game using a quantum mechanical system that gurantees to solve the game with a probability of 1. We methods such that it seems that Alice and Bob are communucating, hence the name Quantum pseudo-telepathy. This game has been [recently implemented] (https://medium.com/qiskit/this-proof-demonstrates-a-quantum-advantage-even-for-noisy-quantum-computers-b44a738801ad) and our aim is to explain it in detail and extend it to real quantum computers. In the orginal publication, rather than graphical tiles denoted with A & B as in the illustration above, conceptionally equivilant digits +1 and -1 are amployed for comptation. Hereafter, the tile B will be replaced by +1 and tile A by -1. \n",
    "\n",
    "To the end of implemenation, the Python Qiskit framework was employed. Subsequently, this notebook will introduce the quantum circuit solving the MPG game, provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the mathematical operation applied during an exemplary game and quantify it's performance on both simulated and real quantum computers. First, for the subsequent circuit definition, evaluation and illustration, we first have to define auxiliary functions and import the corresponding modules from Qiskit and Numpy"

    "As we have demonstrated above, the quantum circuit solves the Mirmin-Peres game (MPG) on simulators with a higher probability than with any classical strategy on ordinary computers possible. To shed some light on how and why this works, we present and explain the mathematical operations that lead to the solution of this game. In particular, we will first present a high-level equation describing the mathematical rationale and then we will take a look at each element of this equation explain it step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the quantum circuit has to play different moves for each different row/column instances of the MPG being selected, since there is no classical strategy that can win the game with probability = 1. Thus, to win with probability 1, the quantum circuit dynamically adapts to the input of each column and row played. Nevertheless, there is indeed one part of the circuit that remains static and is responsible for generating a matching qubit state, that entangles the qubits of Alice and Bob. As this part comes prior to any adaptation we will start off by focusing on that part. \n",

    "These operators can then be translated into the [following quantum gates] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01502.pdf) for the r(spective row / column selected.
