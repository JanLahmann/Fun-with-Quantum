    "\n",
    "The Boolean satisfiability problem [(SAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) considers a Boolean expression with N boolean variables involving negation (NOT, $\\neg$), conjunction (AND, $\\wedge$) and disjunction (OR, $\\vee$), as in the following (simple) example:  \n",
    "$$ f(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 \\vee x_2) \\wedge (x_1 \\vee \\neg x_2) . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is to determine whether there is any assignment of values (TRUE, FALSE) to the Boolean variables which makes the formula true. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's something like trying to flip a bunch of switches to find the setting that makes a light bulb turn on.  \n",
