# Fun with Quantum
"Fun with Quantum" is planned to be a colletion of Jupyter notebooks that highlight specific aspects of Quantum Computing that are interesting and/or fun.

### 1. Quantum Coin Game 
A quantum coin game that illustrates the power of quantum superposition and interference  - implemented by Jan-R. Lahmann using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org), [binder](https://mybinder.org) and [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Inspired by the TED talk of Shohini Ghose ["Quantum computing explained in 10 minutes"](https://www.ted.com/talks/shohini_ghose_quantum_computing_explained_in_10_minutes) 

View - and play the game online, without any install - in Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JanLahmann/Fun-with-Quantum/master?filepath=Quantum-Coin-Game.ipynb)

A slightly more current version of this Quantum Coin Game is now part of the official Qiskit Community Tutorials and can be played at http://ibm.biz/QiskitCoinGame

### 2. Simple Quantum Implementation for Boolean satisfiability problems

A simple implementation to solve Boolean satisfiability problems ("3SAT) using Qiskit and Grover's Quantum Search Algorithm. The aim is to show how easy such a problem can be solved on a Quantum Computer using Qiskit. To keep it as simple as possible, the theory is not explained in this notebook.

Walk through this demo (and change it if you like) in Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JanLahmann/Fun-with-Quantum/master?filepath=3sat.ipynb)

### 4. GHZ Game (under development)

A quantum game that illustrates the power of quantum entanglement  - implemented by Isabell Heider using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org), [binder](https://mybinder.org) and [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

View - and play the game online, without any install - in Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JanLahmann/Fun-with-Quantum/master?filepath=GHZ-Game.ipynb)

### 5. Hardy's Paradox (under development)
A tutorial that discusses a specific version of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Paradox  - implemented by Jan-R. Lahmann using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org), [binder](https://mybinder.org) and [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), based on an idea in a former version of the [Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook)

## Usage instructions for the RISE Slideshow Extension
Some of the binder images in this repository automatically launch RISE, a Jupyter/IPython Slideshow Extension.  
Navigation is easy:

1. "Ctrl -" and "Ctrl +" (or "command -", "command +") adjust the zoom level to fit the text to the browser window
* Use "Space" and "Shift Space" to navigate through the slides (right & left arrow keys also work, but might skip some slides)
* "Shift + Enter" executes the interactive cells (might need to click the cell, first)
* Execute the interactive cells on each slide ("In [1]:", etc)
* In case a cell is not formatted correctly, try to double-click and then "Shift Enter" to re-execute
* Interactive cells can be modified, if needed
* "X" at the top left exits the slideshow and enters the jupyter notebook interface
