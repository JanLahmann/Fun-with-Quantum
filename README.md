# Fun with Quantum
"Fun with Quantum" is planned to be a colletion of Jupyter notebooks that highlight specific aspects of Quantum Computing that are interesting and/or fun.

2. Simple Quantum Implementation for Boolean satisfiability problems [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JanLahmann/Fun-with-Quantum/master?filepath=3sat.ipynb)


### 1. Quantum Coin Game 
A quantum coin game that illustrates the power of quantum superposition and interference  - implemented by Jan-R. Lahmann using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org), [binder](https://mybinder.org) and [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Inspired by the TED talk of Shohini Ghose ["Quantum computing explained in 10 minutes"](https://www.ted.com/talks/shohini_ghose_quantum_computing_explained_in_10_minutes) 

View - and play the game online, without any install - in Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JanLahmann/Fun-with-Quantum/master?filepath=Quantum-Coin-Game.ipynb)

### 2. Simple Quantum Implementation for Boolean satisfiability problems

A simple implementation to solve Boolean satisfiability problems ("3SAT) using Qiskit. The aim is to show how easy such a problem can be solved on a Quantum Computer using Qiskit. To keep it as simple as possible, the theory is not explained in this notebook.

Walk through this demo (and chance it if you like) in Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JanLahmann/Fun-with-Quantum/master?filepath=3sat.ipynb)


## Usage instructions for the RISE Slideshow Extension

Some of the binder images in this repository automatically launch RISE, a Jupyter/IPython Slideshow Extension.  
Navigation is easy:

1. "Ctrl -" and "Ctrl +" (or "command -", "command +") adjust the zoom level to fit the text to the browser window
* Use "Space" and "Shift Space" to navigate through the slides (right & left arrow keys also work, but might skip some slides)
* "Shift + Enter" executes the interactive cells (might need to click the cell, first)
* Execute the interactive cells on each slide ("In [1]:", etc)
* In case a cell is not formatted correctly, try to double-click and then "Shift Enter" to re-execute
* Interactive cells can be modified, if needed
* "X" at the top left exits the slideshow and enters the jupyter notebook interface
