    "The GHZ game is a serious game for quantum computing to show the quantum mechanical property of entanglement. Three players are asked for two different properties A and B of an object, an each property can be one of two conditions 1 or 0. When all are asked for property A, 1 should appear two times or zero times. When two players are asked for property B, 1 should appear three times ore one time. When the players don't know what the other two were asked, respectively, there is no strategy in classical logic that can lead to winning in all cases. Using Quantum Computing, however, there is.

While these are rather simple steps to take, there is an entire research field dealing with how to mitigate quantum computer hardware imperfection with software driven techniques, one of which we will examine now. \n",

    "As discussed earlier, there are various types of errors that can perpetrate noisy results when executing a quantum circuit. A significant one is that what happens when the quantum states are read from qubits forcing them to collapse into classical states, i.e. our experiment should return one of our four targeted classical states (001, 010, 100, or 111). However, we've seen that in our results a lot more states than these incorrectly appear. \n",

Hence, knowing the devices' readout error behavior, we can estimate the real results from our obtained results through matrix multiplication, which is called Measurement Error Mitigation. For this, each basis state (one of the 2^n combinations of 0 and 1 per each of the n qubits, e.g. 00, 01, 10, 11 for 2 qubits) is measured on the device so to derive its measurment errors, allowing to restore our real counts.\n",

Then, adapt the circuit again so to pick qubits with the lowest error rates. This doesn't need to be accurate, as it is hard to weigh the effects of the different kinds of errors present. A good indicator if you did a good job is that the state accuracy of the result is not significantly lower than that of the default circuit or that of the coupling map sensitive circuit without error optimization, respectively.
