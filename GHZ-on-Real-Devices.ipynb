    "The GHZ game is a serious game for quantum computing to show the quantum mechanical property of entanglement. Three players are asked for two different properties A and B of an object, an each property can be one of two conditions 1 or 0. When all are asked for property A, 1 should appear two times or zero times. When two players are asked for property B, 1 should appear three times ore one time. When the players don't know what the other two were asked, respectively, there is no strategy in classical logic that can lead to winning in all cases. Using Quantum Computing, however, there is.

However, we've seen that in our results a lot more states than these incorrectly appear. \n",

Then, adapt the circuit again so to pick qubits with the lowest error rates. This doesn't need to be accurate, as it is hard to weigh the effects of the different kinds of errors present. A good indicator if you did a good job is that the state accuracy of the result is not significantly lower than that of the default circuit or that of the coupling map sensitive circuit without error optimization, respectively. Once you're done, execute the remaining cells in chapters 2-5."
